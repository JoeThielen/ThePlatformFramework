# The Platform Framework

## **_The platform for YOUR framework!_**
#### *Funny name,  Lofty goals.*

Wikipedia defines **Platform** (*[Computing Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform)*) as...
> A computing platform is, in the most general sense, whatever a pre-existing piece of computer software or code object is designed to run within, obeying its constraints, and making use of its facilities.
>
>The term computing platform can refer to different abstraction levels, including a certain hardware architecture, an operating system (OS), and runtime libraries.[1] In total it can be said to be the stage on which computer programs can run.

Wikipedia defines **Framework** (*[Software Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework)*) as...
> In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software.

## What is The Platform Framework???
This project was established to help provide a platform for projects aimed at small- to medium-sized organizations/businesses. 

## Could you be a little more... specific?
Let's say you've got a [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) project and want to get it up and running at a business.  Maybe hardware isn't your thing.  Maybe you're a bit frightened by all the hacking going on.  This project aims to provide a platform for your project, using several specific technologies to help *armor* your project.   Additionally, the goal is to provide specifics on how, exactly, to get a server loaded with your project running on this platform into the hands of the target organization / business.  

Another way to put it is this project aims to provide you with what you need in order to turn *your* project into a [turn-key appliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_appliance).  

## Project Goals / Guidelines
* The target is primarily small- to medium-sized businesses.
  * Enterprise already has a wealth of solutions involving multiple servers, data centers, cloud technologies, etc..
* Emphasis on security and automation.
  * Both of these should be involved in every step of the project, top to bottom and start to finish.
* No *cloud* needed! The entire system is local, on-premesis.
  * In some cases, the organization / business may not wish to, or may even be required to not, have their data *in the cloud*...
  * The project is not necessarily *anti-cloud*, it simply recognizes the need (or want) for some organizations / businesses to keep their data local.
* Easy of use - *for the organization/business*.
  * Businesses, *small or large*, are cheap **AND** lazy! 
    * Common themes (*the project in no way endorses these behaviors, it simply recognizes they exist*): 
      * The bottom-line is king (**$$$**). 
      * Maintenance is deferred. 
      * No such thing as corporate ethics. 
    * The goal is to *recognize these factors and adapt...*
  * No/Low maintenance - should not need constant IT oversight.  **_AUTOMATION!_**
* Can we get the whole system to run on one machine?
  * Redundant/replication servers are another goal.
  * Development environment server.

## Why the name *The Platform Framework*?

The original project creator found it childishly amusing.  And the domain name was available...


## Current project status

The project is newly created.
